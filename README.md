# react-auth-be

BE part of [auth](https://github.com/mb-dir/react-auth-fe) project, thanks to this I became familiar with concepts such as

- JWT
- middlewares related with auth
- MVC concept
- rest API


It was written based on [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2EqECiTBL8&t=1s) tutorial(but it's not like ctrl+c, ctrl+v ðŸš«)

## tech stack(FE+BE)

- MongoDB
